🧹 Data Cleaning Process
The following steps were performed on the raw dataset:
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values:
- Rows with missing critical values (price per unit, quantity) were removed

- Converted data into Excel Tables for structured analysis
- Created calculated fields (e.g., total spent)

- Total Revenue
- Total Transactions
- Unique Customers
- Average Order Value

- Revenue by Location (Online vs In-store)
- Top 10 Best-Selling Items
- Revenue Distribution by Payment Method


📉 Dashboard Features
The final dashboard includes:
- Interactive charts powered by Pivot Tables
- Clean and professional layout for easy interpretation

Visualizations Used:
- Column Charts
- Bar Charts
- Donut Charts


💡 Key Business Insights
- Certain product categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue
